Welcome to my Github repo. You'll not find anything major here, this is primarily my location for code storage to enable code access over different computers.
I'm a master's student in computer science at Uppsala University currently producing my final thesis. The thesis regards the development of a _collision warning system_ for multi-rotor drones. 
So it contains a mixture of *object detection*, *object tracking* and *distance estimation*. There's an additional twist to this project, however that's a secret for now.

Got tired of seeing Github's own produced README garbage on my profile, hence the creation of this passage.
